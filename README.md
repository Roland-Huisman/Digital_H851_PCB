Digital DEC H851 topconnector PCB


The "Gerber files for Dec H851.zip" contains the files to produce new H851 PCB's if you want to repair your original H851. In a later project I've used these PCB's to make four H851 out of one H803 connector board.

When you order these PCB's please give a note to your PCB supplier: These PCB's have no silkscreen, no soldermask, and are fully tinned.

The boards are really cheap at JLCPCB but they will ask you if you are sure about the PCB. That is because DEC made his PCB's in a way we are not used to anymore... (No silkscreen, no soldermask, fully tinned)
